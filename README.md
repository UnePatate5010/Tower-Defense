# Tower-Defense

This is a school project done in early-mid 2023. The goal was to create from scratch a [tower defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense) game in TS. The twist was the (mandatory) use of functional programming which is, let's be honest, not really adapted to game.
Nonetheless, we did our best to respect the chosen paradigm. That is a reason why our code is messy and really difficult to read  (an other reason being us being bad :pepeKMS:). The game is displayed in the terminal.
